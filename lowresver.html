            <h2><em>I'm a Furry</em></h2>
            <p>So what is a furry? Well on a surface level, a furry is someone who's intrested in anthropamorphic animals and usually has a character or <em>fursona</em> as it's called to represent them.<br>Some people even make up a backstory for thier character while others don't. My character is basically just an avatar for myself because while I had an idea for a story in my head<br> I haven't had the time or drive to write it.</p>

            <h2>How long have I been using VR Chat?</h2>
            <p>About 2 years, I started back in Januaray of 2021 when I got my VR headset which is an Oculus (<strong>I refuse to call it a meta device</strong>) Quest 2. And it is what made me become a furry. In fact, here's one of the earliest pictures of me in VR Chat, from around the time I started wearing an Avali avatar.</p>
